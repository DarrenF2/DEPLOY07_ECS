FROM openjdk:11
COPY ./demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Then we go to ECS and create a networking only cluster and select Fargate, the serverless compute engine, which is one of AWSâ€™ managed services.

Create a new Pipeline and connect it to you Github Repo

Add the Jenkins file to the Github Repo that you will be using to create the image of the
